    <p>Grilled pork chops brushed with a honey and soy sauce mix. To round out the meal, serve with creamy chive and garlic mashed potatoes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 center-cut boneless pork chops, 1/2 inch thick</li>
                <li>2 tsp canola oil</li>
                <li>1 large sweet onion</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Mix honey, soy sauce, crushed red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a bowl. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the honey-soy mixture into a small bowl and save for later. Brush chops with canola oil on both sides, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Grill the chops on the hottest part of the grill until lightly charred and crusty, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Move the chops to a cooler area of the grill, and continue to cook, brushing both sides generously with the honey-soy glaze, until chops are no longer pink inside, about 3 to 4 more minutes. The juices should run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
                <li>While chops are grilling, brush slices of onion with oil, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Grill onion slices until they are translucent and browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. To serve, place chops and onions on warmed plates, and brush the chops with the reserved honey-soy glaze.</li>
            </ol>
